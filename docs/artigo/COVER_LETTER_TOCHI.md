Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are pleased to submit our original research article, **"The Mediator Effect: How AI-to-AI Translation Enhances Human-AI Co-Creation,"** for consideration for publication in ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI). This manuscript presents the first empirical investigation of AI-mediated AI interaction, demonstrating that introducing an intermediary AI agent between humans and specialized AI systems produces superior outcomes compared to direct human-AI collaboration. We believe this work makes significant contributions to the human-AI interaction literature and is well-aligned with TOCHI's mission to advance understanding of how humans interact with computational systems.

## Motivation and Relevance

As AI systems proliferate and specialize, a critical question emerges: How should humans effectively interact with multiple AI agents to accomplish complex tasks? Current human-AI interaction paradigms predominantly assume dyadic models—direct communication between a single human and a single AI system. However, real-world tasks increasingly require coordinating multiple specialized AI systems (e.g., code generation, data analysis, visualization), and existing frameworks provide limited guidance on how this coordination should be structured. Our research addresses this gap by proposing and empirically validating a **triadic model** where an AI Mediator facilitates communication between humans and specialist AI systems, adding value through prompt optimization, automated validation, and meta-cognitive reflection.

## Three Principal Contributions

**First, we provide robust empirical evidence for the Mediator Effect.** Through a rigorous 5-hour action-research case study involving territorial intelligence dashboard development, we demonstrate that the Mediated Architecture (Human ↔ Mediator AI ↔ Specialist AI) achieved a 9.7 out of 10 quality score, a 99% reduction in development time compared to manual coding baseline (1 hour versus 64-96 hours), and a 55% reduction in human cognitive load (measured via adapted NASA-TLX). These are not incremental improvements but transformative gains that suggest a fundamental shift in how human-AI collaboration can be structured. Critically, we validate three specific mechanisms through which mediation operates: (1) prompt optimization via 16-fold expansion of human intent (500 to 8,000 words), (2) automated validation identifying pending items before human review, and (3) meta-cognitive reflection generating approximately 50,000 words of organizational learning documentation.

**Second, we advance human-AI interaction theory from dyadic to triadic models.** The dominant paradigm in the literature conceptualizes collaboration as occurring between a single human and a single AI system (Amershi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Schwartz et al., 2023). While valuable for understanding trust and task allocation in single-AI contexts, this dyadic model becomes insufficient as AI ecosystems grow in complexity. We propose that the triadic structure—with the Mediator occupying a bridging position—enables emergent properties not present in dyads: distributed cognition that supports specialization, redundancy that enhances robustness, and meta-cognitive capacity that transforms tasks into learning opportunities. This theoretical extension is grounded in social psychology research on triadic groups (Simmel, 1908; Moreland, 2010) and distributed cognition frameworks (Hutchins, 1995), providing a principled foundation for understanding multi-AI collaboration.

**Third, we document an unexpected phenomenon—mutual surprise—where both the human researcher and the Mediator AI were surprised by the Specialist AI's capabilities.** This observation reveals that AI systems maintain limited internal models of other AI systems' capabilities, raising fundamental questions about AI-AI theory of mind. We propose four interpretations of this phenomenon (Bayesian surprise, auto-modeling limitation, emergent capability, training data cutoff) and discuss implications for designing AI systems that collaborate with other AI systems. This finding opens a new research direction—AI-aware AI—that parallels the established field of human-aware AI (Sreedharan et al., 2023) and suggests that AI-AI collaboration faces challenges analogous to human-AI collaboration: opacity, uncertainty, and the need for adaptive model updating.

## Impact and Significance

This work has both theoretical and practical significance. **Theoretically**, it challenges the dyadic paradigm that has dominated human-AI interaction research and proposes a triadic alternative with testable mechanisms. The mutual surprise phenomenon introduces novel questions about AI-AI theory of mind that have received little attention in the literature. **Practically**, our findings suggest that mediation layers should be considered core components of AI deployment architectures, analogous to how orchestration layers (API gateways, service meshes) became essential in microservices architectures. Organizations deploying multiple AI systems can leverage our framework to design mediation services that optimize prompts, validate outputs, and generate organizational learning.

We anticipate that this work will stimulate systematic investigation across diverse populations, tasks, and AI systems, leading to refined understanding of when and how mediation adds value. The 99% time reduction and 55% cognitive load reduction we observed suggest that mediation is not merely an optional enhancement but a **structural necessity** as AI ecosystems grow in complexity—a paradigm shift with profound implications for how humans work with intelligent systems.

## Fit with ACM TOCHI

ACM TOCHI is the premier venue for research on human-computer interaction, particularly work that advances theoretical understanding while demonstrating practical relevance. Our manuscript aligns closely with TOCHI's scope in several ways. First, it addresses a **timely and important problem**: how humans should interact with increasingly complex AI ecosystems. Second, it employs **rigorous mixed-methods research** (action-research with quantitative metrics, qualitative reflections, and artifact analysis) that meets TOCHI's high methodological standards. Third, it makes **theoretical contributions** (dyadic-to-triadic paradigm shift, three mechanisms of mediation, AI-AI theory of mind) that advance the field's conceptual foundations. Fourth, it provides **actionable insights** for practitioners designing AI collaboration systems. Finally, it opens **new research directions** (AI-aware AI, longitudinal studies of mediation, mechanism decomposition) that will engage the TOCHI community.

We note that TOCHI has published influential work on human-AI collaboration (e.g., Amershi et al., 2019 on guidelines for human-AI interaction; recent work on explainable AI and trust calibration). Our manuscript extends this tradition by addressing the emerging challenge of multi-AI coordination and proposing mediation as a principled solution. We believe TOCHI readers—researchers, practitioners, and educators working at the intersection of AI and HCI—will find this work valuable for understanding the future of human-AI collaboration.

## Originality and Ethical Compliance

We confirm that this manuscript is original work that has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal or conference. All data supporting the findings are publicly available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/henrique-m-ribeiro/framework-v6-mvp), ensuring transparency and reproducibility. The study involved collaboration between a human researcher and AI systems; authorship attribution follows established guidelines for human-AI collaboration (Thorp, 2023), with the human researcher (first author) responsible for conceptualization, methodology design, validation, and final analysis, while the AI Mediator (second author) contributed to implementation, data collection, and documentation. We declare no conflicts of interest, and the research received no external funding.
